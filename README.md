# WeatherOutlook
Weather outlook for the next 3 hours
## What's the deal
Ever wanted to go outside with friends and by the time you all _finally_ meet up at 4 PM, it started raining? 
Ever left the house on sunny weather and came home to a flooded house?
This doesn't have to happen again! With Weather Outlook you can view the weather for the upcoming period of time
## What can it do?
For every 3 hours there is line that tells you what the weather will be like and what's the temptature gonna be. There's also that 
special little button that shows you more than just the next 9 hours, you can see the timeline for the next 3 days! 
## So, a weather app.
Well, not exactly. See weather apps often stuff useless information to your face, when all you really wanna know is how's the 
weather gonna be within couple of hours. Weather Outlook is meant to simplify the quick check if the clouds that you see out of your window
should bother you or not.
